# img-to-txt
Have you ever been sent text in an image file, that you've wanted to copy and paste?
Unfortunately not everyone owns the latest Macbook or iPhone with inbuilt ML/AI capabilities to extract text from images.
This is simple GUI app for extracting text from images.
Note: This will not work for hand written notes and is best suited for screenshots.
